# Data Analytics: Skills & Knowledge Assessment

## Strengths
- Out of the four core areas, data analytics is the one I have the most knowledge and experience in.
- I am proficient in creating and interpreting predictive models efficiently.
- Over time, RapidMiner has become an intuitive tool for me. I used it extensively in CIDM 6308 to build machine learning models for classification tasks.
- Although I have more experience with RapidMiner and Excel, I feel comfortable using Power BI for data visualization and reporting.
- I have a strong grasp of Excel functionalities, particularly for data cleaning, pivot tables, and formula-based analysis. Many data analytics tasks in coursework relied on Excel for preprocessing before model deployment.

## Weaknesses
- I have limited experience with Tableau. While I understand the basics, I have not had enough opportunities to work on in-depth visualization projects using it.
- Struggled with some aspects of Microsoft Azure.
- Struggled with cleaning data for CIDM 5310.

## Wants/Wishes
- I would like to have a deeper understanding of certain models like Neural Networks.
- Improve my proficiency with Tableau so I can confidently utilize it in professional settings.
- Have more exposure to Power BI beyond CIDM 5310 to improve my ability to create interactive reports and dashboards.

My exposure to these tools provides a solid foundation for future career applications. As organizations continue leveraging data for decision-making, my competencies in predictive modeling, data mining, and visualization will be highly relevant.

# Data Analytics: Integration

## Why and How Data Analytics is Integrable with Other Areas
- Data mining involves extracting valuable information from datasets, while data analytics takes that information and ensures that it is meaningful. Data management on the other hand makes sure data is stored in a manner that can be used in data analytics and decision-making.
- Systems development is aided by data analytics as it allows software engineers and developers to optimize system performance through analyzing user behavior and system efficiency. Additionally, predictive models can be used to detect potential system failures before they occur.
- Networking and cybersecurity makes use of data analytics through analyzing network traffic patterns to detect any anomalies and cyber security threats. Organizations can also improve their cybersecurity strategies by analyzing past attacks and/or security breaches.

## How Data Analytics is Integrable with Prior Work
- In both CIDM 5310 and 6308, data mining and data management played a crucial role in projects. Many assignments required cleaning and structuring raw data before applying analytics techniques.

## Integration Statement
Data analytics serves as the backbone of modern technology by transforming raw data into actionable insights. Whether in data mining and management, systems development, or networking and cybersecurity, analytics enables informed decision-making, enhances efficiency, and strengthens security.

## Preparedness
Given my background in predictive modeling, data mining, and visualization tools, I am well-prepared to integrate data analytics into my capstone project. Whether through Power BI dashboards, machine learning models, or data-driven security analysis, I can apply my skills to create impactful solutions. My work samples, coupled with my continued learning in advanced analytics concepts and tools, will allow me to develop a comprehensive portfolio that showcases my expertise in data analytics.
