# Systems Development: Skills & Knowledge Assessment

## Strengths
- Reinforced my understanding of programming languages such as Python, SQL, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
- Gained experience in web development through Django and Docker.
- Successfully applied data engineering and data science concepts in projects.
- Benefited from DataCamp courses to refine weak areas and expand knowledge in CIDM 6303.
- Learned significantly from extra/advanced coursework beyond standard assignments in CIDM 6303.

## Weaknesses
- Some advanced Python and SQL concepts from DataCamp were difficult to grasp initially.
- Certain Python and SQL operators were unfamiliar and required extra practice.
- Encountered difficulties with the Python shell and specific Django components like the admin page in CIDM 6325.
- Using a Windows environment instead of Unix/Linux-based systems made parts of the coursework more difficult to complete in CIDM 6325.

## Wants/Wishes
- Gain a deeper mastery of advanced Python and SQL operators.
- Improve proficiency in using Django’s administration page.
- Enhance my ability to work with Unix/Linux-based systems to adapt to diverse development environments.

# Systems Development: Integration

## Why and How Systems Development is Integrable with Other Areas
- Systems development supports data analytics by providing the necessary infrastructure for data collection, storage, and processing, ensuring smooth data flow for analytical applications.
- Effective systems development ensures databases and data pipelines are structured for efficient querying and analysis.
- Secure software development practices, authentication mechanisms, and API integrations help in maintaining the integrity of networked systems.

## How Systems Development is Integrable with Prior Work
- Web applications in CIDM 6325 utilized Django and Python, integrating data management and web-based analytics.
- SQL-based projects in CIDM 6303 reinforced database management skills, supporting both data analytics and system development efforts.
- Docker experience helped in understanding deployment and scalability, crucial for modern software development.

## Integration Statement
Systems development acts as the foundation for efficient data processing, web application functionality, and secure computing environments. By integrating software engineering with data management, analytics, and security, it ensures that technological solutions are scalable, reliable, and effective.

## Preparedness
My proficiency in programming, databases, and web development, along with my experience in handling real-world projects, positions me well to contribute to software and data-driven solutions. Strengthening my Unix/Linux skills and mastering advanced Python/SQL concepts will further enhance my ability to develop robust systems for future applications.
